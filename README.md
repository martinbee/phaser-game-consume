# Boilerplate

This codebase is boilerplate for es6 webpack phaser projects

## Setup
- `npm i`
- `npm start`

## Customize
Change the object defined in states/index.js to create your own states, or add
new states in /states/. Be sure to import your states and start them on the game
instance defined in src/index.js.
